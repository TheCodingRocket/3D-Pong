<h2>TODO</h2>

* Possibly add a small moving obstacle (mirror sphere or box) that randomly slides on the floor, changing the ball direction if it gets hit. ;-)<br>
* Network gameplay for 2 players using WebSockets would be a great addition (if I can ever find the time!) ;)

<h2>ABOUT</h2>

* Following my AntiGravity Pool [game](https://github.com/erichlof/AntiGravity-Pool), this is the second in a series of real-time fully path traced games for all devices with a browser, including mobile. The technology behind this simple game is a combination of my three.js path tracing [project](https://github.com/erichlof/THREE.js-PathTracing-Renderer) and the WebAudio API for sound effects.  The goal of this project and others like it is enabling path traced real-time games for all players, regardless of their system specs and GPU power. <br>
