</h1>

<h3 align="center">
  Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

  Oh yeah, and you could also play it in mobile.

   How to play it

<h3 align="center">On computer, use your mouse or trackpad

   How the game was made
</h1>

<h3 align="center">The GameRunner. A minimal framework for creating canvas games, it provides a 60fps double buffered canvas game loop, allowing the game itself to concentrate on updating its game state whenever the update() method is called and rendering itself every time the draw() method is called.
  </h3>

<h3 align="center">I then used the GameRunner framework to display a simple bouncing ball example, showing the separation of the GameRunner from the Pong game itself.</h3>

<h3 align="center">The game loop. Starting with a basic menu, waiting for user input to start a game, running the game until there is a winner, or the user abandons it, and then going back to the menu (and repeat).</h3>

<h3 align="center">I get to the meat of the game itself, implementing the collision detection between paddle and ball makes the game playable for the first time. There is no computer AI.</h3>

<h3 align="center">The final step was to implement a rudimentary AI for the computer player. Allowing us to run single player games or even adjust the difficulty of the game itself.</h3>
