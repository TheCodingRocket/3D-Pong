</h1>

<h3 align="center">
  In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold. Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualize relativistic effects, such as why different observers perceive differently where and when events occur. 
  </h3>

<h3 align="center">
 Starfield was built to visualize the very core of the speed of light. how we perceive and see reality in a different point of view. The point of creating Starfield is to make simulations more accesible to everyone.

Adjusting the speed
</h1>
 
 <h3 align="center">
 You can adjust the speed of the simulation. To go slower, hover your mouse / track pad to the left. To go faster and visualize the speed of light, hover your mouse or track pad to the right. But if you want the best of both worlds, hover your mouse / track pad to the middle, where you can see the stars and planets pass by.

1. Create and change the web link

   ```sh
   Download or Fork the repository
   ```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   Use any Code Editor to change anything you don't like
   ```
3. Host the repository

   ```sh
   Once you're finish editing the contents host the site
   ```
4. Enjoy the simulation

   ```sh
   Thats it you're finsihed
   ```
